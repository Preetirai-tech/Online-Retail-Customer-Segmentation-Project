# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation-Project

## Description
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an online retail business. By applying various clustering techniques to the customer data, we aim to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and demographics. This segmentation analysis can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Features
- Utilized K-means clustering algorithm with silhouette score evaluation for optimal cluster count determination.
- Applied K-means clustering with the elbow method to identify the ideal number of clusters using within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
- Implemented Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to analyze hierarchical relationships among customer segments.
- Incorporated DBSCAN algorithm for identifying dense regions in the data and handling noisy data points effectively.
